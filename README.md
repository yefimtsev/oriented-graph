Class **BBSolver** is responsible for solution algorithm.
For now, you can only manually input needed graph via setupGraph method, changing first three constants accordingly.

- **DEFAULT_START_NODE** -- this constant is responsible for picking "_default node_".
- **DEFAULT_END_NODE** -- this constant is responsible for picking "_last node_" (e.g. such node where we want go to)
- **NUMBER_OF_NODES** -- change this constant to reflect your _graph's nodes number_.

Class **Graph** is a basic approach to represent data type **Graph**.
